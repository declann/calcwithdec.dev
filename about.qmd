I'm Declan. I'm a modeller - I work with numbers, mostly in actuarial departments. ðŸ“Š

I also develop [calculang](https://github.com/calculang/calculang), with a mission to democratise numbers. A life project and still a baby ðŸŒ±

This website is **under construction** ðŸš§

I made this it to share my thoughts about modelling ("calcs") and stuff. Don't treat it like professional work or advice.

If you want my professional work or advice, send me a hello by electronic mail to: [declann1990@gmail.com](mailto:declann1990@gmail.com) ðŸ™‚
