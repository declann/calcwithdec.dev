To track my changes to drafty version on ObservableHQ i.e. https://observablehq.com/@declann/calculang-tools-bad
and attempt to at least be able to keep code in sync, this ohq folder is periodically (and manually) updated with the main js file from exporting the notebook on OHQ, and package.json from the same archive, to keep track of some metadata (version).

I should be able to automate this.

For avoidance of doubt, the code I've renamed to main.js is generated by using ObservableHQ web interface to Export a notebook.
